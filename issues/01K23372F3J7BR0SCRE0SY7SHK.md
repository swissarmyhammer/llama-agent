# Sophisticated Tool Call Dependency Analysis

## Description

The `should_execute_in_parallel` method in `agent.rs:455` currently uses a simple heuristic to determine if tool calls can be executed in parallel. There's a TODO comment indicating the need for more sophisticated dependency analysis.

## Current Implementation

```rust
fn should_execute_in_parallel(&self, tool_calls: &[ToolCall]) -> bool {
    // Simple heuristic: execute in parallel if there are multiple calls
    // and they don't appear to be interdependent
    
    // For now, enable parallel execution for most cases
    // TODO: Add more sophisticated dependency analysis
    if tool_calls.len() <= 1 {
        return false;
    }
    // ... rest of method
}
```

## Requirements

Implement sophisticated dependency analysis that can:

1. **Data Flow Analysis**: Detect when one tool call's output might be needed as input for another
2. **Resource Conflict Detection**: Identify tools that might conflict when run simultaneously
3. **Dependency Graph**: Build a dependency graph to optimize execution order
4. **Safety Checks**: Ensure parallel execution won't cause race conditions or data corruption

## Implementation Approach

1. Analyze tool call parameters for dependencies on previous results
2. Check for shared resources or file system conflicts
3. Implement a dependency resolution algorithm
4. Add configuration for tool-specific parallel execution rules
5. Include safety mechanisms for rollback if parallel execution fails
