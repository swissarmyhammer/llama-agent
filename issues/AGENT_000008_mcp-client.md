# MCP Client Integration

Refer to ./specifications/index.md

## Objective
Implement MCP client using rmcp for external tool integration and server management.

## Tasks
- [ ] Create `mcp.rs` module with MCPClient struct
- [ ] Integrate rmcp crate for MCP server connections
- [ ] Implement server initialization from MCPServerConfig
- [ ] Add tool discovery across all connected MCP servers
- [ ] Implement tool execution with proper error handling
- [ ] Create server lifecycle management (start/stop/health)
- [ ] Add connection retry and recovery logic
- [ ] Handle MCP protocol communication and serialization

## Key Methods
- `MCPClient::initialize(configs: Vec<MCPServerConfig>) -> Result<Self, MCPError>`
- `discover_tools() -> Result<Vec<ToolDefinition>, MCPError>`
- `call_tool(server_name: &str, tool_name: &str, args: Value) -> Result<Value, MCPError>`
- `list_servers() -> Vec<String>`
- `server_health(server_name: &str) -> Result<HealthStatus, MCPError>`

## MCP Integration
- Use rmcp for server process management and communication
- Handle stdio-based MCP server connections
- Manage server lifecycle (spawn, monitor, cleanup)
- Tool discovery aggregation across multiple servers
- Request/response handling with proper timeouts

## Error Handling
- MCPError variants for connection, communication, tool execution failures
- Server process monitoring and failure detection
- Tool execution timeout and retry logic
- Protocol error handling and recovery
- Graceful degradation when servers are unavailable

## Server Management
- Track server state and availability
- Handle server restarts and connection recovery
- Resource cleanup on shutdown
- Process monitoring and health checks

## Acceptance Criteria
- Successfully connects to MCP servers using rmcp
- Tool discovery works across multiple servers
- Tool execution handles success and error cases
- Server lifecycle is properly managed
- Connection failures are handled gracefully
- All MCP communication follows protocol specifications
