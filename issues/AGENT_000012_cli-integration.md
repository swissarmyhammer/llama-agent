# CLI Agent Integration

Refer to ./specifications/index.md

## Objective
Integrate the CLI with the agent library to provide end-to-end functionality.

## Tasks
- [ ] Initialize AgentServer from CLI configuration
- [ ] Create session and process user prompt
- [ ] Handle model loading with progress indication
- [ ] Implement basic chat loop for user interaction
- [ ] Add response formatting and output
- [ ] Handle tool calls in CLI context (basic support)
- [ ] Add proper error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Implement graceful shutdown and cleanup

## Core Integration
- Use llama-agent library's AgentServer
- Initialize with CLI-provided configuration
- Create session for user interaction
- Process generation requests and display responses

## User Experience
- Show progress during model loading
- Format responses nicely for terminal display
- Handle long responses with appropriate paging/formatting
- Provide clear error messages for failures
- Support interrupt handling (Ctrl+C)

## Basic Tool Support
- If model generates tool calls, display them to user
- Basic tool execution support for demonstration
- Handle tool results and follow-up generation
- Clear indication when tools are being used

## Response Handling
- Display generation progress for long responses
- Format output appropriately for terminal
- Handle streaming responses (if supported)
- Show generation statistics (tokens, time)

## Acceptance Criteria
- CLI successfully loads models from both HF and local sources
- User prompts are processed and responses displayed
- Model loading shows appropriate progress
- Error conditions are handled gracefully
- Tool calls are detected and displayed
- CLI provides good user experience
- Proper cleanup on exit
