# Request Queue Infrastructure

Refer to ./specifications/index.md

## Objective
Implement thread-safe request queue for serializing access to the single model instance.

## Tasks
- [ ] Create `queue.rs` module with RequestQueue struct
- [ ] Implement QueuedRequest internal type with oneshot response channels
- [ ] Create worker thread pool for processing requests
- [ ] Add support for both batch and streaming requests
- [ ] Implement request timeout handling
- [ ] Add queue capacity limits and backpressure
- [ ] Create proper shutdown handling for worker threads
- [ ] Add queue health monitoring and metrics

## Architecture
- MPSC channel for request submission
- Worker threads process requests sequentially against model
- Oneshot channels for batch request responses
- MPSC channels for streaming request chunks
- Arc<Mutex<>> protection for shared model access

## Key Methods
- `RequestQueue::new(model: Arc<LlamaModel>, config: QueueConfig)`
- `submit_request(request: GenerationRequest) -> Result<GenerationResponse>`
- `submit_streaming_request(request) -> Result<impl Stream<StreamChunk>>`
- Proper graceful shutdown with `shutdown()` method

## Error Handling
- QueueError variants for timeouts, capacity, worker failures
- Proper error propagation from workers to callers
- Request cancellation support
- Worker thread panic recovery

## Acceptance Criteria
- Queue handles concurrent requests safely
- Worker threads process requests in order
- Timeout handling works correctly
- Queue capacity limits prevent memory issues
- Streaming requests work without blocking batch requests
- Graceful shutdown cleans up all resources
## Proposed Solution

After analyzing the existing codebase, I found that the `RequestQueue` infrastructure is already well-established in `queue.rs:29-318` with the following components:

### Current Implementation Status
1. ‚úÖ `RequestQueue` struct with MPSC channels
2. ‚úÖ `QueuedRequest` internal type with oneshot response channels  
3. ‚úÖ Worker thread pool for processing requests
4. ‚úÖ Request timeout handling
5. ‚úÖ Queue capacity limits and backpressure
6. ‚úÖ Proper shutdown handling for worker threads
7. ‚úÖ Queue health monitoring (basic)
8. ‚ùå **MISSING**: Real streaming request implementation
9. ‚ùå **MISSING**: Real model inference in batch processing

### Key Issues to Resolve
1. **Streaming Implementation**: Line 202-226 has placeholder error for streaming
2. **Model Inference**: Line 278-296 has mock text generation instead of real llama-cpp calls
3. **Context Management**: Need proper context lifecycle management per request

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Complete Batch Request Processing
- Replace mock implementation in `process_batch_request_sync()` with real llama-cpp inference
- Implement proper prompt formatting using session messages
- Add stop token handling and finish reason detection
- Implement proper token counting and timing

#### Phase 2: Implement Streaming Requests
- Create streaming inference loop with tokio channels
- Handle token-by-token generation with progress callbacks
- Implement proper cancellation for streaming requests
- Add backpressure handling for streaming channels

#### Phase 3: Enhanced Error Handling
- Add request cancellation support via CancellationToken
- Implement worker thread panic recovery
- Add detailed error propagation from llama-cpp layer
- Implement request retry logic for transient failures

#### Phase 4: Performance Optimizations
- Add queue health metrics (processing times, queue depth)
- Implement request prioritization if needed
- Add memory usage monitoring
- Optimize context reuse across requests

### Code Changes Required

1. **Update `process_batch_request_sync()`** - Replace mock with real inference
2. **Implement `process_streaming_request()`** - New function for streaming
3. **Add context management** - Proper lifecycle for LlamaContext per request
4. **Update error handling** - More granular error types and recovery
5. **Add metrics collection** - Queue performance monitoring

This approach leverages the solid foundation already built and focuses on completing the missing inference implementations.
