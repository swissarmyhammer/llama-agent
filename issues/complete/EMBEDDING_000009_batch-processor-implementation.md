# EMBEDDING_000009: Implement BatchProcessor for Efficient Processing

## Overview
Implement `BatchProcessor` that efficiently processes multiple texts in batches, with streaming support for large files and configurable batch sizes.

Refer to ./specification/embedding.md

## Tasks

### 1. Implement BatchProcessor Struct
```rust
// llama-embedding/src/batch.rs
pub struct BatchProcessor {
    model: Arc<EmbeddingModel>,
    batch_size: usize,
}
```

### 2. Batch Processing Methods
```rust
impl BatchProcessor {
    pub fn new(model: Arc<EmbeddingModel>, batch_size: usize) -> Self;
    pub async fn process_batch(&mut self, texts: &[String]) -> Result<Vec<EmbeddingResult>, EmbeddingError>;
    pub async fn process_texts(&mut self, texts: Vec<String>) -> Result<Vec<EmbeddingResult>, EmbeddingError>;
}
```

### 3. File Processing with Streaming
```rust
impl BatchProcessor {
    pub async fn process_file(&mut self, input_path: &Path) -> Result<impl Iterator<Item = EmbeddingResult>, EmbeddingError>;
    pub async fn process_file_streaming<F>(&mut self, input_path: &Path, callback: F) -> Result<(), EmbeddingError>
    where
        F: Fn(Vec<EmbeddingResult>) -> Result<(), EmbeddingError>;
}
```

### 4. Efficient Batch Processing
- Process texts in configurable batch sizes (default: 32)
- Minimize memory usage for large files
- Stream results to avoid memory accumulation
- Handle empty lines and invalid text gracefully
- Progress tracking and statistics

### 5. Memory Management
- Use streaming file reading to handle large inputs
- Process and yield results in batches to control memory
- Configurable batch sizes for different memory constraints
- Efficient text parsing and handling

### 6. Error Handling and Recovery
- Handle individual text processing failures within batches
- Continue processing on non-fatal errors
- Collect and report batch-level statistics
- Graceful handling of file reading errors

### 7. Performance Optimizations
- Minimize string copying and allocations
- Efficient batch preparation for model inference
- Parallel processing within batches where possible
- Memory reuse and pooling strategies

## Success Criteria
- [ ] BatchProcessor compiles and basic tests pass
- [ ] Can process batches of texts efficiently
- [ ] File streaming works for large inputs
- [ ] Memory usage scales predictably with batch size
- [ ] Error handling allows graceful continuation
- [ ] Performance suitable for 1000+ text processing
- [ ] Statistics and progress tracking work

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for batch processing logic
- Test with various batch sizes (1, 8, 32, 64)
- Test with large text files (1000+ lines)
- Test memory usage doesn't grow unbounded
- Test error handling and recovery
- Performance testing for reasonable throughput

## Integration Notes
- This will be the primary interface used by the CLI
- Must handle production-scale workloads efficiently  
- Focus on memory efficiency and throughput
- Should provide progress feedback capabilities

## Proposed Solution

After analyzing the current implementation in `llama-embedding/src/batch.rs`, I found that the BatchProcessor is already largely implemented with most of the requested functionality. The current implementation provides:

### ‚úÖ Already Implemented
1. **BatchProcessor struct** with Arc<EmbeddingModel> and configurable batch size
2. **Core batch methods**: `process_batch()`, `process_texts()` with efficient chunking  
3. **File processing**: `process_file()` with memory-efficient streaming file reading
4. **Streaming support**: `process_file_streaming()` with callback and `process_file_as_stream()` returning async streams
5. **Error handling**: Continue-on-error support, graceful degradation, proper error reporting
6. **Statistics tracking**: `BatchStats` with success rates, timing, and performance metrics
7. **Memory management**: Streaming file processing, configurable batch sizes, minimal memory footprint
8. **Comprehensive tests**: Unit tests covering edge cases, error scenarios, and functionality

### üîß Improvements to Implement
1. **Enhanced Statistics**: Add more detailed performance metrics and memory usage tracking
2. **Progress Callbacks**: Improve progress reporting with better granularity and user feedback
3. **Memory Optimizations**: Add memory pooling and more efficient text handling
4. **Production Readiness**: Verify scalability and performance under production loads
5. **Integration Testing**: Test with actual embedding models to validate real-world performance

### Implementation Steps
1. Enhance `BatchStats` with additional metrics (throughput, memory usage, error categorization)
2. Add configurable progress reporting with callback interface
3. Implement memory pooling for text processing to reduce allocations  
4. Add performance benchmarks and memory usage validation
5. Create integration tests with real embedding models
6. Verify the actual embedding generation implementation in model.rs (currently using placeholders)

The BatchProcessor architecture is solid and meets the specification requirements. The focus will be on performance optimizations, enhanced monitoring, and ensuring production-scale reliability.
