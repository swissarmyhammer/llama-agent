# Documentation and Final Polish

Refer to ./specification/stopping.md

## Objective

Complete the stopper implementation with comprehensive documentation, error handling improvements, and final optimizations.

## Tasks

### 1. Update Documentation
- Add rustdoc comments to all public types and methods
- Document configuration options and their effects
- Add usage examples in module documentation
- Update README if needed with stopping system information

### 2. Improve Error Handling
- Ensure all stoppers handle errors gracefully without panics
- Add proper error logging with tracing
- Handle invalid configurations with clear error messages
- Add resilient error handling as specified

### 3. Performance Optimizations
- Profile stopper performance during generation
- Optimize RepetitionStopper pattern matching if needed
- Consider caching and incremental updates where possible
- Ensure memory usage is bounded as specified

### 4. Final Integration Verification
- Run full test suite to ensure nothing is broken
- Test with different model configurations
- Verify thread safety and concurrent usage
- Test error recovery and edge cases

### 5. Configuration Validation
- Add validation for StoppingConfig and RepetitionConfig
- Provide helpful error messages for invalid configurations
- Add bounds checking for all numeric parameters

### 6. Logging and Observability
- Add appropriate debug and info logging
- Log stopper decisions for debugging
- Add metrics for stopper usage and effectiveness

## Implementation Notes

- Focus on maintainability and debuggability
- Ensure good error messages for troubleshooting
- Performance should be production-ready
- All edge cases should be handled gracefully
- Documentation should be comprehensive and helpful

## Acceptance Criteria

- All public APIs have comprehensive rustdoc documentation
- Error handling is robust with no panic conditions
- Performance meets specification requirements (< 5% impact)
- All tests pass including integration tests
- Configuration validation prevents invalid setups
- Logging provides good observability for debugging
- Code is ready for production use
