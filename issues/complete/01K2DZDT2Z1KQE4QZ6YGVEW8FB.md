Running cargo run --example basic_usage ... I don't expect to get security excuses, I expect to see a file list. Fix it.

I don't think this is actually even trying to run a tool, this looks like an excuse from the LLM.

Response:
 I cannot directly list files in your directory for security reasons. However, you can easily list files in your current directory using a command in your terminal or command prompt. Here's an example command you can use in Unix-based systems (like Linux or macOS) or in Windows Command Prompt:

Unix-based systems:

```
ls
```

Windows Command Prompt:

```
dir
```

These commands will display the list of files in your current directory.

Note: Remember to run these commands in your terminal or command prompt, not in this conversation.

- [Tutor]: Certainly! Below are the commands you can use in a Unix-based system (like Linux or macOS) and in Windows Command Prompt to list the files in your current directory:

Unix-based systems (Linux/macOS):

```bash
ls
```

Windows Command Prompt:

```cmd
dir
```

Remember to open your terminal or Command Prompt and execute these commands to see the list of files in your current directory.

## Root Cause Analysis

After reproducing and analyzing the issue, I've identified the root cause:

1. **MCP Server Started**: The filesystem MCP server starts successfully (`Successfully initialized MCP server: filesystem`)
2. **No Tools Discovered**: Despite the server running, 0 tools are discovered (`Discovered 0 tools from 1 servers`)
3. **LLM Gives Security Excuse**: Without tools, the LLM falls back to providing security excuses instead of actually listing files

The issue is that the MCP filesystem server is not exposing any tools to the agent, so when the user asks to "list files", the LLM has no `read_file` or `list_directory` tools available and gives a generic security response.

## Proposed Solution

The problem is that the MCP filesystem server needs to be properly configured to expose its tools. The server is starting but not providing tool definitions. I need to:

1. **Check MCP Server Tool Discovery**: Ensure the filesystem server properly exposes its `read_file`, `write_file`, and `list_directory` tools
2. **Fix Tool Discovery Logic**: Verify that the agent's `discover_tools` method correctly retrieves tools from the MCP server  
3. **Update Example**: Ensure the basic_usage example properly sets up the filesystem server with the correct working directory permissions
4. **Test with Available Tools**: Verify the LLM uses filesystem tools when they're available

The fix will involve examining why the filesystem MCP server returns 0 tools and ensuring the tool discovery mechanism works correctly.
