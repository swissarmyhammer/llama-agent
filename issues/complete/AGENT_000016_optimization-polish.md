## Proposed Solution

After analyzing the issue requirements, I will implement comprehensive optimization and polish improvements in the following systematic approach:

### 1. Performance Analysis and Optimization
- **Model Loading**: Optimize initialization time and memory allocation patterns
- **Memory Management**: Profile memory usage, identify leaks, and optimize allocations
- **Queue Performance**: Analyze throughput bottlenecks and optimize request handling
- **Streaming Optimization**: Improve real-time response performance

### 2. Resource Management Enhancement
- **Proper Cleanup**: Implement comprehensive resource disposal patterns
- **Shutdown Procedures**: Add graceful shutdown with timeout handling
- **Connection Pooling**: Optimize MCP client connection reuse
- **Memory Bounds**: Add configurable memory limits and monitoring

### 3. User Experience Polish
- **Error Messages**: Make errors actionable with clear guidance
- **Progress Indicators**: Add progress feedback for long operations
- **Configuration Validation**: Improve config error messages and defaults
- **CLI UX**: Enhanced command-line experience with better help

### 4. Security and Validation
- **Input Sanitization**: Add comprehensive input validation
- **Resource Limits**: Prevent DoS with configurable limits  
- **File Handling**: Secure temporary file operations
- **Dependency Audit**: Review and update dependencies for security

### 5. Quality Assurance
- **Performance Testing**: Benchmark critical paths
- **Integration Validation**: Test with real models and MCP servers
- **Regression Testing**: Ensure optimizations don't break functionality
- **Documentation Review**: Verify accuracy and completeness

### Technical Implementation Strategy
- Use Rust profiling tools (`cargo flamegraph`, memory profilers)
- Implement configurable resource limits and monitoring
- Add graceful degradation patterns for missing dependencies
- Follow performance best practices (zero-copy where possible, efficient allocations)
- Add comprehensive logging for production debugging

This optimization will ensure the system meets production requirements for performance, reliability, and security.
