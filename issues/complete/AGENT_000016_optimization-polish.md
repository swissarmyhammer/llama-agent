# Final Optimization and Polish

Refer to ./specifications/index.md

## Objective
Optimize performance, add final polish, and ensure production readiness.

## Tasks
- [ ] Performance optimization of model loading and inference
- [ ] Memory usage optimization and leak detection
- [ ] Queue performance tuning and optimization
- [ ] Error message improvement and user experience polish
- [ ] Resource cleanup and proper shutdown procedures  
- [ ] Security review and input validation
- [ ] Final dependency updates and compatibility checks
- [ ] Documentation review and completeness check

## Performance Optimization
- Model loading time optimization
- Memory usage profiling and optimization
- Queue throughput and latency optimization
- Streaming performance improvements
- Connection pooling for MCP clients
- Caching where appropriate

## Resource Management
- Proper resource cleanup on shutdown
- Memory leak detection and fixes
- File handle and connection management
- Thread pool sizing optimization
- Resource usage monitoring and limits

## Polish and UX
- Error message clarity and actionability
- Progress indicators for long operations
- Graceful degradation for missing dependencies
- Configuration validation and helpful defaults
- CLI user experience improvements

## Security and Validation
- Input validation for all external inputs
- Safe handling of model files and MCP communications
- Resource limits to prevent DoS
- Secure temporary file handling
- Dependency security audit

## Quality Assurance
- Final test suite execution
- Integration testing with real models and MCP servers
- Performance regression testing
- Documentation accuracy verification
- API stability review

## Acceptance Criteria
- Performance meets or exceeds specification requirements
- Memory usage is optimized and bounded
- All resources are properly cleaned up
- Error handling provides excellent user experience
- Security review passes without major issues
- System is ready for production deployment
