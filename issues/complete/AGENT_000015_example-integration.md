# Example Integration and Documentation

Refer to ./specifications/index.md

## Objective
Create comprehensive examples and documentation demonstrating the complete system functionality.

## Tasks

- [ ] Create streaming example demonstrating real-time responses
- [ ] Add error handling examples for common failure modes
- [ ] Create configuration examples for various scenarios
- [ ] Add performance and optimization examples
- [ ] Document best practices and common patterns

## Core Example (from specification)
- Implement the exact usage example from the specification
- HuggingFace model loading with DialoGPT-medium
- Session creation with MCP server configuration
- Tool discovery and integration
- User message processing with tool calls
- Tool execution and result integration
- Follow-up generation with tool results

## Additional Examples
- Local model loading example
- Streaming generation example  
- Multiple MCP server integration
- Error handling and recovery patterns
- Custom configuration scenarios
- CLI usage examples for various cases

## Documentation
- API documentation with examples
- Configuration guide with all options
- MCP integration guide
- Troubleshooting common issues
- Performance tuning recommendations
- Best practices for production use

## Integration Testing
- End-to-end example execution as tests
- Real MCP server integration testing
- Performance benchmarking examples
- Resource usage monitoring examples

## Acceptance Criteria
- Specification example runs exactly as documented
- Additional examples cover major use cases
- Documentation is comprehensive and accurate
- Examples serve as integration tests
- Performance characteristics are documented
- Common issues and solutions are covered

## Proposed Solution

After analyzing the specifications at ./specifications/index.md, I will implement comprehensive examples and documentation in the following steps:

### 1. Core Implementation Analysis
- Examine current codebase structure and implementation status
- Identify what components are already implemented vs need to be created
- Ensure alignment with the specification's architecture

### 2. Specification Usage Example (Lines 605-709)
- Implement the exact example from the specification showing:
  - AgentConfig with HuggingFace model loading (microsoft/DialoGPT-medium)
  - Session creation with MCP server configuration (filesystem server)
  - Tool discovery and integration
  - User message processing triggering tool calls
  - Tool execution and result integration
  - Follow-up generation with tool results

### 3. CLI Examples Implementation
- Create working examples for all CLI usage patterns:
  - HuggingFace model with auto-detection
  - HuggingFace with specific filename
  - Local model folder
  - Local specific file
- Ensure proper argument parsing and validation

### 4. Advanced Examples
- Streaming generation example with real-time token output
- Multiple MCP server integration showing different tool types
- Error handling patterns for common failure scenarios
- Performance monitoring and optimization examples

### 5. Documentation and Testing
- Comprehensive API documentation with working examples
- Integration tests that validate each example
- Troubleshooting guide for common issues
- Best practices documentation

### Technical Approach
- Follow TDD: write tests that validate examples work correctly
- Use existing patterns and libraries from the codebase
- Ensure all examples can run independently
- Add proper error handling and logging
- Include performance benchmarking where relevant

This solution will provide a complete reference implementation that demonstrates all major functionality of the llama-agent system.
