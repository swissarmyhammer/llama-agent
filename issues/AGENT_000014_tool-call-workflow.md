# Tool Call Workflow Integration

Refer to ./specifications/index.md

## Objective
Implement complete tool call workflow from detection through execution to result integration.

## Tasks
- [ ] Enhance chat template engine with robust tool call parsing
- [ ] Implement tool call detection in generated responses
- [ ] Add tool execution workflow in AgentServer
- [ ] Create tool result integration back into session
- [ ] Handle multi-step tool call scenarios
- [ ] Add tool call validation and error recovery
- [ ] Implement tool call logging and debugging
- [ ] Add support for parallel tool execution

## Tool Call Flow
1. Model generates response with tool calls
2. ChatTemplateEngine extracts tool calls from text
3. AgentServer validates tool calls against available tools
4. MCPClient executes tools via appropriate servers
5. Tool results are integrated back into session
6. Follow-up generation incorporates tool results

## Tool Call Processing
- Parse various tool call formats (JSON, special tokens)
- Validate tool calls against session's available tools
- Handle malformed or invalid tool calls gracefully
- Support for multiple tool calls in single response
- Proper error handling for tool execution failures

## Result Integration
- Add tool results as Tool role messages in session
- Maintain tool call ID tracking for correlation
- Handle tool execution errors in session context
- Support for follow-up generation after tool calls
- Preserve conversation flow with tool interactions

## Error Handling
- Invalid tool call format recovery
- Tool execution timeout handling
- Missing tool or server error recovery
- Partial tool call success scenarios
- Clear error reporting to user

## Acceptance Criteria
- Tool calls are reliably detected and parsed
- Tool execution integrates with MCP servers correctly
- Tool results are properly integrated into sessions
- Multi-step tool workflows function correctly
- Error cases are handled gracefully
- Tool call workflow is properly tested
