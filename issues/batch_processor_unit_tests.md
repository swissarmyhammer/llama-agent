# Implement Proper Unit Tests for Batch Processor

## Problem
The batch processor test in `llama-embedding/src/batch.rs:632` contains a placeholder test that doesn't actually test functionality:

```rust
// We can't actually create an EmbeddingModel in unit tests
// without proper setup, but we can test the structure
assert_eq!(1, 1); // Placeholder test to verify compilation
```

## Requirements
1. **Mock Model Testing**: Create mock embedding models for unit testing
2. **Batch Processing Logic**: Test the actual batch processing algorithms
3. **Error Scenarios**: Test error handling and edge cases
4. **Performance Testing**: Validate batch size optimization
5. **Integration Boundaries**: Test interfaces without requiring full model loading

## Implementation Strategy
1. Create mock/test implementations of EmbeddingModel trait
2. Test batch processing logic with mock data
3. Add tests for error conditions and edge cases
4. Test batch size calculations and memory management
5. Validate concurrent processing behavior

## Files to Modify
- `llama-embedding/src/batch.rs:632` - Replace placeholder test
- Add test utilities for creating mock embedding models

## Success Criteria
- Real functionality is tested without requiring model files
- All batch processing code paths are covered
- Error scenarios are properly tested
- Test performance is acceptable (fast unit tests)
- Tests provide confidence in batch processor correctness

## Proposed Solution

After analyzing the codebase, I will implement proper unit tests for the BatchProcessor by creating a mock EmbeddingModel that doesn't require actual model files or initialization. Here's my implementation plan:

### 1. Mock EmbeddingModel Design
- Create a `MockEmbeddingModel` struct that implements the same interface as `EmbeddingModel`
- Mock methods will return predictable results for testing without requiring llama-cpp-2 backend
- Allow configurable behavior (success/failure scenarios, custom embeddings, processing times)

### 2. Test Structure
- Replace the placeholder test at line 632 with comprehensive functionality tests
- Test batch processing logic with various batch sizes and configurations  
- Test error handling (continue_on_error vs stop_on_error behavior)
- Test memory monitoring and limits
- Test progress reporting functionality
- Test concurrent processing behavior

### 3. Test Coverage Areas
- **Basic Functionality**: Batch creation, processing, and result collection
- **Error Scenarios**: Model not loaded, text processing failures, memory limits
- **Edge Cases**: Empty batches, oversized batches, invalid configurations
- **Performance**: Batch size optimization, memory usage tracking
- **Integration**: Progress callbacks, statistics tracking

### 4. Mock Implementation Strategy
- Implement mock that doesn't depend on external model files
- Provide configurable embedding dimensions and processing times
- Simulate various error conditions for comprehensive testing
- Use deterministic behavior for consistent test results

This approach will provide real functionality testing while maintaining fast unit test execution times.
