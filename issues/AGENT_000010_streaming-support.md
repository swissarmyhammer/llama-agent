# Streaming Response Implementation

Refer to ./specifications/index.md

## Objective
Implement streaming response support for real-time text generation with proper flow control.

## Tasks
- [ ] Enhance RequestQueue to support streaming requests
- [ ] Create StreamChunk type with text, completion status, token count
- [ ] Implement streaming channels and flow control
- [ ] Add streaming support to AgentServer
- [ ] Create streaming response processing in request queue workers
- [ ] Handle streaming errors and cancellation
- [ ] Add proper backpressure handling
- [ ] Integrate streaming with chat template processing

## Streaming Architecture
- MPSC channels for streaming chunk delivery
- Non-blocking stream processing in worker threads
- Proper cancellation support for interrupted streams
- Flow control to prevent memory buildup
- Error propagation through stream

## StreamChunk Implementation
- Text content for partial generation
- Completion status flag
- Token count for progress tracking
- Optional metadata (timing, token IDs)
- Serializable for network transmission

## Integration Points
- RequestQueue worker threads handle streaming generation
- AgentServer provides streaming API endpoint
- Chat template engine works with partial content
- Session updates handle streaming context
- Error handling preserves stream state

## Flow Control
- Bounded channels prevent memory issues
- Backpressure handling when consumer is slow
- Cancellation support for interrupted requests
- Resource cleanup on stream completion/cancellation

## Acceptance Criteria
- Streaming responses work without blocking batch requests
- StreamChunk provides meaningful progress information
- Stream cancellation cleans up resources properly
- Backpressure prevents memory issues
- Streaming integrates with session management
- Error handling maintains stream consistency
