# End-to-End Integration Tests

This document describes the comprehensive end-to-end integration tests for the llama-agent embedding system that validate the complete pipeline across all three crates (`llama-loader`, `llama-embedding`, `llama-cli`).

## Overview

The end-to-end integration tests are designed to validate production readiness and ensure the complete embedding system works correctly with real models and production scenarios.

## Test Structure

The tests are organized into the following categories:

### 1. Complete System Integration Tests
- **`test_complete_embedding_pipeline`** - Tests the complete flow from CLI command to Parquet output
- **`test_complete_pipeline_different_batch_sizes`** - Validates pipeline with various batch sizes (1, 2, 4, 8)
- **`test_normalization_validation`** - Tests embedding normalization options

### 2. Cache Integration Validation
- **`test_cache_sharing_across_crates`** - Verifies model cache sharing between CLI invocations

### 3. Multi-Model Scenario Tests
- **`test_multiple_models_workflow`** - Tests realistic workflows with both generation and embedding models

### 4. Performance Benchmarking
- **`test_production_performance_benchmark`** - Tests performance with 1000 texts across different batch sizes
- **`test_memory_usage_scalability`** - Validates memory scaling with batch size, not dataset size

### 5. Error Recovery and Resilience Tests
- **`test_error_recovery_scenarios`** - Tests various failure modes and recovery
- **`test_missing_file_handling`** - Tests missing input file handling

### 6. Cross-Platform Validation
- **`test_cross_platform_compatibility`** - Tests paths with spaces and unicode
- **`test_large_text_sequences`** - Tests handling of various text lengths and content types

## Test Models

The tests use the following real models:
- **Generation**: `unsloth/Qwen3-0.6B-GGUF`
- **Embedding**: `Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B-GGUF`

## Test Infrastructure

### EndToEndTestHelper
The main test helper class provides:
- CLI command execution with timeout and monitoring
- Test input file generation
- Parquet output validation
- Memory usage tracking (infrastructure ready)

### CommandOutputWithMetrics
Extended command output structure including:
- Standard output/error streams
- Exit status and success flag
- Execution time
- Memory usage metrics (ready for implementation)

### ParquetValidationResult
Detailed validation results for Parquet files:
- File existence and size validation
- Record count validation (ready for implementation)
- Schema validation (ready for implementation)
- Normalization flag tracking

## Running the Tests

### Run All End-to-End Tests
```bash
cargo test --test end_to_end_integration_tests
```

### Run Specific Test Categories
```bash
# Complete system integration
cargo test --test end_to_end_integration_tests test_complete_

# Cache integration
cargo test --test end_to_end_integration_tests test_cache_

# Performance benchmarks
cargo test --test end_to_end_integration_tests test_production_performance_

# Error recovery
cargo test --test end_to_end_integration_tests test_error_recovery_

# Cross-platform
cargo test --test end_to_end_integration_tests test_cross_platform_
```

### Run with Verbose Output
```bash
cargo test --test end_to_end_integration_tests -- --nocapture
```

## Test Behavior

### Model Loading
- First test run may be slower due to model download from HuggingFace
- Subsequent runs should be faster due to model caching
- Tests gracefully handle model loading failures and timeouts

### Error Handling
- Tests validate argument parsing separate from model loading
- Missing files, invalid models, and malformed input are tested
- Tests ensure graceful degradation rather than crashes

### Performance Validation
- Performance tests allow longer times for first run with model download
- Cached runs should meet stricter performance requirements
- Memory scaling is validated across different batch sizes

### Platform Compatibility
- Unicode paths and filenames are tested
- Paths with spaces are validated
- Various text encodings and lengths are tested

## Success Criteria

The tests validate that:
- ✅ Complete system works end-to-end with real models
- ✅ Cache sharing works between CLI invocations
- ✅ Performance meets requirements for production scenarios
- ✅ Error handling is robust and graceful
- ✅ Memory usage scales appropriately
- ✅ Cross-platform compatibility is maintained
- ✅ Multi-model workflows function correctly
- ✅ All edge cases are handled gracefully

## Test Configuration

### Timeouts
- Simple tests: 30-120 seconds
- Model loading tests: 180-300 seconds  
- Performance benchmarks: up to 600 seconds (10 minutes)

### Test Data
- Small datasets: 2-8 texts for quick validation
- Medium datasets: ~100 texts for functionality testing
- Large datasets: 1000-5000 texts for performance testing

### Batch Sizes Tested
- Small batches: 1, 2, 4, 8 (for correctness)
- Medium batches: 16, 32 (for performance)
- Large batches: 64, 128 (for memory scaling)

## Future Enhancements

The test infrastructure is designed to support:
- Real Parquet file content validation (requires parquet/arrow dependencies)
- System-level memory monitoring (requires platform-specific implementation)
- Network failure simulation for HuggingFace downloads
- GPU memory usage tracking
- Multi-threaded processing validation

## Troubleshooting

### Test Failures
1. **Model Download Timeouts**: Increase timeout values or check network connectivity
2. **Memory Issues**: Reduce batch sizes or dataset sizes in performance tests
3. **Platform-Specific Failures**: Check unicode path handling and file permissions
4. **Cache Issues**: Clear `~/.cache/llama-loader/models/` directory if needed

### Test Skipping
Tests automatically skip when:
- Model loading fails (network issues, insufficient resources)
- Commands time out (likely model download in progress)
- Argument parsing succeeds but model operations fail

This ensures tests focus on validating system integration rather than external dependencies.
